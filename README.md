# CRUD_Application
# you need to create a virtual environ ment and set it up with  the code , which makes the sql server easy to manage the data ,
also you need to install sql server separately which is kinda boring and timetaking , i will try later in future to manage a application which 
doesnt need a separate SQL server to manage data.
